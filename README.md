## üõ†Ô∏èFeatures
* Start a connection with a stream to receive messages.
* Stop an active stream connection.

* Application of the Long Polling concept using a maximum of 8 seconds to obtain messages.
* Limit of up to a maximum of 6 connections.
* Treatment to ensure that messages are not sent on more than one different channel.

## üîçComments
* To make it simpler, I am removing the database whenever we start the application, given the limit of interactions that can be created, this way we also do not overload the database with messages that have already been sent in other executions.
